<!DOCTYPE html>
<!--
  HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the foundation of every webpage.
  It defines the STRUCTURE and CONTENT of your page - like the skeleton of a building.
  
  This file tells the browser:
  - What text to display
  - Where images go
  - How content is organized (headings, paragraphs, lists, etc.)
  
  HTML uses "tags" (like <h1>, <p>, <div>) to mark up content.
  Most tags come in pairs: an opening tag (<tag>) and a closing tag (</tag>).
-->

<html lang="en">
<!--
  The <html> tag wraps everything on the page.
  lang="en" tells browsers this page is in English (helps with accessibility and translation).
-->

<head>
  <!--
    The <head> section contains information ABOUT your page that users don't see directly.
    This includes the page title (shown in browser tabs), links to CSS files, and metadata.
  -->
  
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <!--
    This tells the browser what character encoding to use.
    UTF-8 supports all languages and special characters - always include this!
  -->
  
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <!--
    This makes your page work well on mobile devices.
    It tells the browser to match the screen width and start at 1x zoom.
  -->
  
  <title>My First Website</title>
  <!--
    TODO #1: Change the text between <title> and </title> to something personal.
    This text appears in the browser tab, not on the page itself.
    Example: <title>Sarah's Portfolio</title>
  -->
  
  <!--
    This links your CSS file (style.css) to this HTML page.
    CSS controls how your page LOOKS (colors, fonts, spacing, layout).
  -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>

<body>
  <!--
    The <body> tag contains everything that users will SEE on your webpage.
    All your content goes here: text, images, buttons, etc.
  -->
  
  <!--
    HEADER SECTION
    The <header> tag is a semantic HTML element - it tells browsers and screen readers
    "this is the top section of the page." Using semantic tags helps with accessibility.
  -->
  <header> 
    <!--
      NAVIGATION BAR
      The <nav> tag is a semantic HTML element for navigation links.
      This navigation bar appears at the top of every page and helps users
      move between different sections of your website.
    -->
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="index.html">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="about.html">About</a></li>
        <li><a href="projects.html">Projects</a></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
    
    <!--
      TODO #2: Add a heading here using the <h1> tag.
      Example: <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
      
      HTML has 6 heading levels: <h1> (biggest) through <h6> (smallest).
      Use <h1> only once per page for the main title.
    -->
    
    <!-- TODO #2: Add your heading here -->
    <section class="hero">
      <h1>Virat's Portfolio</h1>
      <p>Computer Science Student Interested in web development</p>
    </section>
  
  </header>
  
  <!--
    MAIN CONTENT SECTION
    The <main> tag wraps the primary content of your page.
    This helps screen readers and search engines understand your page structure.
  -->
  <main>
    <!--
      TODO #3: Add a paragraph about yourself using the <p> tag.
      Example: <p>Hi! I'm a student learning web development. I love coding!</p>
    -->
    <section id="about">
      <h2>About</h2>
      <img src="static/cat.webp" alt="Profile Picture" class="profile-img"></img>
      <p>I'm a student learning web development, I enjoy building websites and learning new technologies. This portfolio show cases some of my recent projects.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- TODO #3: Add your paragraph here -->
    
    <!--
      TODO #4: Create a list of your favorite things.
      Use <ul> (unordered list) for bullet points, or <ol> (ordered list) for numbers.
      Each item goes inside an <li> (list item) tag.
      
      Example:
      <ul>
        <li>Pizza</li>
        <li>Video games</li>
        <li>Coding</li>
      </ul>
    -->
    
    <!-- TODO #4: Add your list here -->
    
    <!--
      TODO #5: Add a button using the <button> tag.
      Give it an id attribute so you can select it in JavaScript later.
      Example: <button id="myButton">Click Me!</button>
    -->
    
    <!-- TODO #5: Add your button here -->
    
    <!--
      TODO #6: Add an image placeholder.
      Use the <img> tag. Images don't have closing tags.
      The src attribute points to the image file.
      The alt attribute describes the image for screen readers (accessibility).
      
      Example:
      <img src="assets/my-photo.jpg" alt="A photo of me">
      
      Note: You don't need to add an actual image file right now.
      You can use a placeholder URL like: src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300"
      Or leave it commented out until you have an image ready.
    -->
    
    <!-- TODO #6: Add your image here -->
    
    <!--
      TODO #7: Create a new section with an id attribute.
      This will be useful later when you learn about linking to specific parts of the page.
      
      Example:
      <section id="about-me">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>More content here...</p>
      </section>
    -->
    
    <!-- TODO #7: Add your new section here -->
    
  </main>
  
  <!--
    FOOTER SECTION
    The <footer> tag is another semantic element for the bottom of your page.
    Common footer content: copyright info, links, contact info.
  -->
  <footer>
    <p>Created during the Website Building Workshop</p>
    <!-- TODO #8: Add your name or a personal message to the footer -->
  </footer>
  
  <!--
    This links your JavaScript file (script.js) to this HTML page.
    JavaScript controls INTERACTIVITY and BEHAVIOR (what happens when users click buttons, etc.).
    
    The "defer" attribute means the script will run AFTER the HTML is fully loaded.
    This is important so JavaScript can find the HTML elements it needs to work with.
  -->
  <script defer src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
